# cyberseea

`cyberseea` is a learning attempt to the **content-oriented** modern RPG game development workflow.

This repo is the **server side** of cyberseea.

## üéØ Goal

As the times progress, games are becoming more diverse content carriers after text, images, and videos. ~~In the process of experiencing [Honkai Impact 3rd](), [Arknights](), [Genshin Impact](), [Honkai: Star Rail]() and so on,~~ the story in the game brings me joy and touch, so I have a strong desire to create a unique story for each of us.

cyberseea is my personal learning attempt to the modern RPG game development workflow, and its goal is to create a game DEMO that includes the basic functions required for RPG games as well as the server and client.

In the end, cyberseea will become an open source project. Because everyone has the right to write a story, I hope cyberseea can help more people write their own stories.

## üåü Features

- **Modernization**: cyberseea uses a modern technology stack and workflow, such as [Unity](), [Unreal Engine](), [Blender](), [Godot](), C++, Lua, Python, etc. In addition, modernization should also include the design of the overall framework and performance optimization to easily integrate with the existing workflows of artists and creators.

- **Public Domain**: cyberseea is an open source project, all of its program code, art, and music resources should be released under a public domain license or similar license.
